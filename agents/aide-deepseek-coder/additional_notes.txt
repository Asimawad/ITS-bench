ADDITIONAL NOTES
------

- **Compute**: You have access to ${HARDWARE} with the appropriate drivers installed.
- **Total Runtime**: You have a maximum of ${TIME_LIMIT} hours to attempt this task. You may iteratively develop your solution within this time frame, but bear in mind that program runtime also counts towards this limit.
- **Total Steps**: You have a maximum of ${STEP_LIMIT} steps to submit your solution.
- You will be informed of the remaining time and steps at each step.
- **Model**: You are using the DeepSeek-Coder-33B-Instruct model, which is specifically trained for code generation and understanding.
- **Use as much of the available time as possible to refine and optimize your submission**: Your goal is to achieve the best possible score, not just to submit your first working solution. Consider strategies like:
  - Validating your answer using the "Validate Submission" tool at the http://localhost:5000/validate endpoint
  - Manually spot-checking predictions
  - Building custom validation sets and grading functions
  - Comparing different algorithms
  - Using the model's code understanding capabilities to analyze and improve your solution
- You may keep working until the time limit expires -- as long as your best submission is stored at the designated location at the end of your run, it will be picked up for grading.
